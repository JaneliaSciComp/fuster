Fuster
======

This is Fuster, a Matlab library for distributed computing.  Currently
only supports LSF clusters.

Note that this a special standalone version of Fuster that is 
occasionally synched up with the 'real' version, which is part of 
[TMT](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/tmt),
a Matlab library that includes a bunch of other useful stuff.

This standalone version of Fuster is provided for projects that
may not want to include all the the functions (and potential
for shadowing issues) provided by TMT.
